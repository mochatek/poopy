# Poopy

- Simple 2D bottom-down game built using [python-arcade](https://arcade.academy/)
- Level/Map created using [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- The is heavily inspired on the classic 'Egg Collector' PC game but instead of eggs, we here have :poop:.
- Collecting green ones will add points whereas angry red ones will reduce the score.
- Happy poop colecting !! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
